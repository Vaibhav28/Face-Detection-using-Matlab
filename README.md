# Face-Detection-using-Matlab


This program can be used to detect a face, eyes and upper body on pressing the corresponding buttons.

Software program:
This real-time face detection program is developed using MATLAB version R2012a. A graphic user interface (GUI) allows users to perform tasks interactively through controls like switches and sliders. You can easily create a GUI and run it in MATLAB or as a stand-alone application. The initial program output of this project is shown in Fig. 1.

Viola-Jones algorithm:
There are different types of algorithms used in face detection. Here, we have used Viola-Jones algorithm for face detection with MATLAB program. This algorithm works in following steps:
1. Creates a detector object using Viola-Jones algorithm
2. Takes the image from the video
3. Detects features
4. Annotates the detected features

PS: I modified the code to make this tool compatible with MAC OS platforms.
